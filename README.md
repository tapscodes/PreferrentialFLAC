# PreferrentialFLAC
FLAC file converter to convert them into the exact way I personally like storing them (16 bit, 44100Hz). Goes through folder (and subfolders of that folder) that is selected and changes all the FLAC files.

## Dependencies
- FFmpeg [Download] (https://ffmpeg.org/)
- Python [Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- PySide6 ```pip install PySide6``` for the UI
