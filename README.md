# PreferrentialFLAC
FLAC file converter to convert them into the exact way I personally like storing them (16 bit, 48000Hz) which I found is best for storage, listening, and audio quality. Goes through folder (and subfolders of that folder) that is selected and changes all the FLAC files. This will eventually be part of [Walrio](https://github.com/TAPSOSS/Walrio) music player along with converting your files for you. If this repo is archived this functionality has been included.

## Dependencies
